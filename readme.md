## Description

This project has aim to cover as many analyses as possible, relevant for PMT characterization and calibration. It utilizes a config file that defines what a how it should be done. As the project is not too complex it should encourage **you** to contribute with **your own code**!


Project also contains bunch of python scripts related to a custom hardware and plenty of undocumented analysis.
